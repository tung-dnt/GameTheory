# Game Theory Solver

**Game theory** is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational
decision-makers.
Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science and
biology.

### Game Representations

**Players**: who are the decision makers?
- People? Governments? Companies? Somebody employed by a Company?...

**Strategies**: what can the players do?
- Enter a bid in an auction? Decide whether to end a strike? Decide when to sell a stock? Decide how to vote?...

**Properties**: attributes make up a strategy

**Weights**: a unit to evaluate efficiency of a property

**Payoffs**: what motivates players?
- Do they care about some profit? Do they care about other players?...

#### Normal form

- Lists what payoffs players get as a function of their actions.
- Does not incorporate any notion of sequence, or time, of the actions of the players.
- Usually represented by a matrix.

| **Betray**      | 0,-3                  | **-2,-2**           |

#### Extensive form

- Includes timing of moves.
- Usually represented by a tree.

**Positive affine transformation**: au + b, where a > 0
and b is any real number. Expected utilities are identical to positive affine transformations.

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Simultaneous games</b> (a.k.a. Strategy games) - games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do
       not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them effectively
        simultaneous).
      <p>Usually normal form is used to represent simultaneous games.

      <p><b>Sequential games</b> (a.k.a. Extensive game) - games where later players have some knowledge about earlier 
      actions.
      <p>Usually extensive form is used to represent sequential games.

### Nash Equilibrium

**Nash Equilibrium** - a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to change
his strategy given what the other players are doing.

**Nash Equilibrium** (alternative definition) - a set of strategies, one for each player, such that every player's
strategy is the best response to what the other players are doing.

**Best Response** - a strategy such that a player cannot gain more utility from switching to a different strategy,
given what all other players are doing.

**Mixed Strategy** - a probability distribution over two or more pure strategies, that is, the players choose
randomly among their options in equilibrium.

**Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium** - a set of mixed strategies, one for each player, such that no player has
incentive to change his strategy given what the other players are doing.

**Dominant Strategy** - a strategy that is always better than any other strategy, for any profile of other players'
actions.
- Strictly Dominant Strategy - same as Dominant Strategy
- Weakly Dominant Strategy - a strategy that is always better than or equal to any other strategy, for any profile of
  other players' actions.

**Dominant Strategy Nash Equilibrium** (equilibrium in dominant strategies) - a Nash equilibrium in which all strategies
are strictly dominant. If it exists can be found by elimination of strictly dominated strategies.

**Dominated Strategy** - a strategy, such that, regardless of what any other players do, the strategy earns a player
a smaller payoff than some other strategy.
- Strictly Dominated Strategy - same as Dominated Strategy
- Weakly Dominated Strategy - a strategy, such that, regardless of what any other players do, the strategy earns a
  player a smaller than or equal to some other strategy payoff.

### Problem Description

**Traffic Control**
1) Context: Decision-making in route choosing from A-B to optimize travel time, cost, consumed energy of commuters
  
  ***Sample Map***
  
  ![Screenshot from 2022-06-02 23-06-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71514053/171674924-d5a71334-cef1-4a46-9cfa-8e6c51a8176c.png)
  
   + 4 different commuters with their target is to reach destination B with the lowest cost:
        - Player 1: represent for player choosing route A to C to B
        - Player 2: represent for player choosing route A to C to D to B
        - Player 3: represent for player choosing route A to D to B
        - Player 4: represent for player choosing route A to D to C to B
3) Game Model: <strong>R(G,vi,vj) = { r1,r2,â€¦rQ }</strong> : All the routes from vi to vj consist of the route set R(G, vi, vj)
  Where:
  - vi and vj are two vertices of a graph G 
  - route from vi to vj is represented by r 
  - To calculate T/Time function:  T(f)=Tf(1+0.15(xa/Ca)^4)
  - ***To test Best-Response Dynamics procedure, we can try to calculate the potential energy of each edge***

**Oil Management**
1) Context: Oil can bring great revenues for the economy, along with those benefits, there are potential conflicts due to the interest of many agents involved in the exploration process.
This cheatsheet may help to manage conflicts between countries sharing the same oil resources field by deciding to create an alliance or not.
  - ***Condition***: Each player can have only one strategy at a time
- Normal Player: 4 countries [ A, B, C, D ]
  - ***Player 1 - Country A***:
    + Possesses 40% of the continent's area including both sea and land areas, but the sea area has little oil, and the mainland is mainly mountainous, difficult to exploit, or has no exploitation ability.
    + The continent's largest population, an unstable economy, mainly come from marine exploitation
    + A does not have crude oil processing technology
    + Imports from B at a high price, C at a low price
    + A is in a sea dispute with D because of oil and gas resources in the sea
  - ***Player 2 - Country B***:
    + Own less with only 20%. However, B's oil resources are the second largest of the four countries
    + B has a strong economy with an average population, but because of its rich oil background, it has the strongest economic foundation
    + B does not have crude oil processing technology
    + B's main customer is A, followed by D
    + B transfers crude oil to D at a low price, buys back gasoline at a high price
    + B competes with C in the path of oil export
  - ***Player 3 - Country C***:
    + Owns 30% but has no sea, is located deep in the delta, has the 3rd largest oil and gas resource base in 4 countries
    + The population in C is large, the economy is behind B
    + C has crude oil processing technology, so it sells a lot, sells it at a cheap price to partners, the biggest customer is A, followed by D
  - ***PLayer 4 - Country D***:
    + Own 10%, have the most petroleum resources
    + The population in D is small, the economy is developed
    + D has crude oil processing technology
    + Despite possessing a large area, oil resources are rare, so for many years, A has been in dispute with D as its neighboring country because the oil resources on D are extremely large.
- Properties: 2
  + Amount of (crude) oil consumed
  + Amount of gasoline produced
- For each player, there are 4 strategies: 1 member alliance, 2 member alliances, 3 member alliances, 4 member alliances
2) Game Model:
